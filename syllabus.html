<h4>Course Overview</h4>
<p>Welcome to CIST 1510, Web Development I. A few years ago, I read that 
hands-on is the best way to learn something. I hope that you will take this opportunity to be as hands-on 
as possible. Don't worry about making mistakes, that is also part of the learning process, 
I've certainly made more than my share along the way.</p>
<p>This is an exploratory journey of discovery into the fascinating world of how a web programming 
and how to keep it running. In this journey, we will look at the internal workings of a web page.
We will explore critical thinking, problem solving, troubleshooting, and 
research as it allies to the preceding items. We will address the central question of this course:
<strong>How to create/program web pages and web sites?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I can’t guarantee that it’s going to be your favorite course but it is one of mine. For one thing, you’re
going to have to be here about five hours a day twice a week, and I know at least some of you probably aren’t too
thrilled about that. For another thing, we’re all going to have to work very hard in this class. I
will guarantee, however, that if you work hard, you’ll find that CIST 1510 is one of the most
useful courses you’ll take with us. The skills you develop in this class are skills you can use in
almost every other course you take at this school.</p>
<p>Like everything else, skills and knowledge improve with practice. The more you work with programs, 
the better you will get at doing it. The purpose of the course is to give you lots of opportunities to 
use the skills and apply the knowledge gained by getting hands-on with programming. 
You will have the opportunity to explore the most recent research on programming located on the
Web and apply that in a real world like setting. You’ll be able to understand the basic
nature of programming, and learn about communication patterns within them. You’ll gain insight into the 
role of a person working in the field, and an individual working within 
an organization. You will gain a deeper knowledge of the critical role of
the decision making process relative to this field. This course can help you
more deeply understand these systems, so that you can make wise decisions when you 
are working in this field.

<h5>How will you fulfill these promises?</h5>
<p>To realize these promises you must take responsibility for your own learning and participate as
an active learner. You need to become part of a learning community that we will create
through engaging in the discussion of issues that are common in organizations. The best way
to learn what IT people do is to spend some time doing what they do. 
You will spend time experimenting with real PC's, and you will collect
information that you will bring to class to share and to enrich our discussion. During the semester 
you will write reflections many of your experiences as a member of this class. These reflections will help
you get more out of the experience and it will help us, you and I, evaluate your learning by 
providing you with more accurate feedback. During class discussions, I will provide you with
more explicit information on how to write these reflections. During class, I will also provide you
with information on key concepts and information that will also help you learn.
You will also participate in a specialized small group that will research and wrestle with
some aspects of a computer.</p>

As you move through the course, you're going to be able address do the following:
	
<ul>
<li>Identify HTML 5, CSS 3, and XML</li>
<li>Construct error-free web pages using validation techniques</li>
<li>Construct error-free web applications with interlinking pages, graphical images, 
hyperlinks, tables, forms, and image maps</li>
<li>Evaluate developed code with W3C standards and make necessary corrections</li>
<li>Develop graphics using the HTML 5 Canvas</li>
</ul>

<h4>Expectations for Learning</h4>
<ul>
<li>I expect you to be in class, on time, and prepared. Please have the reading for each class completed
before that day’s session.</li>
<li>I encourage you to participate in class discussions, to ask questions whenever you feel necessary, and to
be engaged with our material generally.</li>
<li>I expect myself to treat you with respect and common courtesy, and I expect you
to reciprocate with both me and your classmates.</li>
<li>On a personal level I have one main expectation for each of you, and I would like you to seriously 
think about adopting it for yourself: <em>I hope each of you will finish this semester feeling that 
you have grown as a person.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>My own philosophy is that an education should prepare students to understand and deal intelligently 
with life in the real world.  It should teach them to think and read critically, to express themselves clearly, 
to frame and ask meaningful questions, to support their positions with reliable evidence, and 
how to solve complex problems. I view teaching as a process of encouraging students to make connections 
between their real world experiences and the subject being studied. <mark>It is important to provide students 
with hands-on activities in order to make these connections which is the way I learned this stuff.</mark> Students should be taught how to 
conduct independent research, how to evaluate a resource, how to develop what 
Postman (Postman 1969) calls a “crap detector”, and how to apply that research to their needs.</p>
<p>Since professions in this rapidly changing field are always improving themselves, 
don't you think you can improve as well? I think you can, and my goal is to help you do just that.</p>

<h5>Reading, Writing, and Thinking in the Course</h5>
<p>To take charge of your own education, you must be willing to read. We will use the homework as a
jumping off point, to give us a common language with which to discuss computers. You will
need to read, analyze, and think about the material between each class. There will also be
additional reading and research as we wrestle with understanding the nature of this device. 
Some of this you will do on your own: some will be with a group of classmates.
We’ll work on abstracting current research so it can be shared among the class.
You will also pursue a topic of special interest and write a paper about that topic (group project).
The writing of the paper will help you refine your thinking and understanding. If you do not
learn to communicate in words, you cannot formulate fully developed thoughts and will,
instead, live by the vague impressions and emotions that often substitute for ideas.
By the end of the course, you should be able to make an informed analysis of the
field and it's role in your life: about the communication involved, about the implications of
organizational decisions on you and your life; and about the ethical responsibility you and
the organization mutually share. It is a big task, and it will take all our efforts to achieve it.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The course requires the attendance of course lectures and practical lab 
demonstration. It requires out of class preparation for classes on a per class 
basis. You are expected to demonstrate the required knowledge/proficiency 
in the subject matter by successfully completing written and/or practical 
tests/projects.</p>
<p><mark>A grade of C or better is required to successfully pass this class.</mark></p>
	
<h4>Instructional Methodology</h4>
<p>In order to better provide you a convenient time to take the class, additional 
instructional materials will be available online. However, the class is hybrid 
because you will need to come in to the labs to complete most hands-on labs and 
also to receive directed assignments to re-enforce reading assignments.The 
instructional methodology will include you completing weekly reading 
assignments in the text and the additional instructional material included in 
the online presentations, taking tests, working on a group class presentation, 
preparing Work Ethics exercises and completing a course portfolios of all work 
completed during the course. The portfolio and reflection statement to be 
included with the portfolio allow you to reflect on their work/efforts 
in the learning environment. Assignments will be sent to the instructor 
via email or turned into the instructor directly. Communication with you 
will be continual as required and will be via email or during class time. 
Additional help will be available to you if needed outside of class. The 
classroom and lab room will be made available for your use at times other than 
scheduled class time.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The course requires the attendance of course lectures
and practical lab demonstration. Out of class work will be assigned each week, 
as will out of class preparation for classes. You are expected to demonstrate 
knowledge, understanding and proficiency in the subject matter by successfully completing 
programming assignments and practical project.</p>

<h4>Materials, Supplies, Etc.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Thumb Drive</li>
<li>Pencil/ Pen and Paper</li>
</ul>

<h4>Required Textbook</h4>
<p>None</p>

<h4>Course Policies</h4>
<h5>Attendance</h5>
<p><mark>One of the keys to your success in college is class attendance.</mark> 
What happens in class is unique and is not easily replaced by copying notes or reading a textbook.</p>
<p>You are responsible to make arrangements to make up all work missed.</p>
<p>The attendance policy is set forth in the North Georgia Technical College Student 
Handbook. I expect you to attend every class, arrive on time, and  prepared—as
you no doubt expect of me. If you can not attend, you should notify me of your absence in advance, 
either by email (preferred) or phone (leave a message if I don't answer).  You are encouraged to 
refer to the Student Handbook for further information regarding the "Drop" Policy.</p>
<p>A warning will be issued before termination for non-attendance. The days absent 
for a warning and termination are as follows:</p>
	   
<table class="table2" style="width:50%; border:1px solid black;">
<tr>
<td style="width:34%; border:1px solid black;"><strong>Class Meeting Per Week</strong></td>
<td style="width:33%; border:1px solid black;"><strong>Absences Before Warning</strong></td>

<td style="width:33%; border:1px solid black;"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td style="width:33%; border:1px solid black;"><strong>2</strong></td>
</tr> 
</table> 
	
<p>If you are absent for more than three days during the semester, your grade may suffer—not
necessarily because you were absent, but because by being absent, you will have missed course
content and classroom experiences that you need to have in order to improve your skills.</p>
<p>Students anticipating a problem complying with the attendance policy should contact 
the instructor in advance or provide notification as soon as possible, the preferred 
method to do this is via email. It is your responsibility to arrange 
for make-up work at the convenience of the instructor. Nothing will be made up without 
a legitimate excuse. The final exam will not be made up.</p>

<h5>Email and Internet</h5>
<p>It is important that we be able to communicate with each other both in and outside of class. Email
is an efficient, effective, relatively painless way to do this. For this reason, I am going to ask 
that you check your NGTC email account at least once a day. I, of course, will do the same. That
way, we should have no trouble communicating.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, I have no objection to your using the classroom computers to check your email
or surf the Web before and after class, but I am going to ask you to refrain from doing so
during our scheduled time together. From the time I start class until the time I dismiss it, you
need to be engaged in the activities planned for the day. Generally speaking, these will not
include emailing your friends and family or surfing the web. I hope I won’t need to say any
more about this. Thanks for your cooperation.</p>

<h5>Late Work</h5>
<p><em>All work is due at the start of class</em> by the day the material is discussed in class, 
so that you can be part of the discussion. Please do
not plan to print, organize, staple, etc. at that time. Do this in advance! If you are absent,
please arrange to turn in your work before as soon as possible. I reserve the right to penalize
late work appropriately, depending on when the work was assigned, when the assignment is
submitted, and how frequently this happens. You are strongly encouraged not to wait until the last minute.</p>

<h5>Grading</h5>
<p>There will be regular projects (Apply Your Knowledge), quizzes, case study (Java Jam) 
and a final project <mark>(You must make at least 70% on the project to pass 
this course)</mark>. Comments in the code are required for all code submitted! See 
<a href="files/1510%20comment%20worked%20example.html">example</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The comprehensive Final Project will count 
40% of your grade, the code must pass the HTML and CSS validators.</li>
<li>Class/Home work will count for 50%; of your grade, 
the code must pass the HTML and CSS validators.</li>
<li>The remaining 10% will be based on class/lab participation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You will not get a passing grade under class participation
if you only do the written assignments but do not contribute to class discussions and class activities.</strong> 
Nothing will be made up without a legitimate excuse. The final exam will not be made up.  
No extra credit will be given unless all course work is turned in to the Instructor.</p>

<p>This course is not self paced so you can achieve an "<strong>A</strong>" as long as your work is turned in in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Make sure your name and exercise number appear in the upper-left corner. 
If an exercise has multiple sheets, then staple them together. Do not staple 
different assignments together. Disorganized assignments (Pages out of order, 
mislabeled, unreadable, etc.) will receive a grade of zero. If there are 
multiple sheets are to be handed in, then sequence them according to the 
order you were told to print them in the exercise.</p>
	
<h5>Class Participation</h5>
<p>Class participation is the single most important aspect of the course. You are expected to actively
participate in every class with a positive attitude and to treat your classmates and teacher with respect. You
are expected to get actively involved with the class activities, to critically analyse the proposed problems
and situations, to actively participate in small group discussions, to contribute your analysis to the whole
class, and to complete all reading and written assignments. You will also conduct oral presentations
throughout the course. Class participation also entails asking meaningful questions in the lectures,
answering questions, and volunteering comments related to the content of the lectures and the class
activities. I will also call on you throughout the course to answer questions or to provide your opinion. We
will resort to a broad range of class activities. Some will be conducted individually and others in small
groups. Many class activities will include the
writing and editing of short essays. Other activities will deal with projects and presentations.
You are expected to be prepared for every class, i.e., you need to do the required readings for each class,
and other homework assignments. You have to keep all your class activities, together with these materials in
a portfolio. Even if you have a laptop, you must also bring a notebook and pens
and be prepared to hand in written class assignments to me when required.</p>
<p>On several occasions throughout the course, I will ask you to hand in the class activities or the entire
portfolio for me to give you formative feedback. It is recommended that you take the initiative and come to my
office during my office hours to discuss your class performance several times throughout the course. Your
class participation must reflect that you have done the required readings and that you have thought about
what you read. Simply talking in class is not enough to get a good grade under this evaluation component.
But, if you do not talk and participate in class, you will not receive any credit at all. Please note that the
written assignments and quizzes are conceived to help you prepare to talk in class and fully
participate in the class activities. <b>You will not get a passing grade under class participation if you only
do the written assignments but do not contribute to class discussions and class activities.</b> I expect that
active class participation will foster, among many other skills, your oral communication and presentation
skills. Class attendance is a prerequisite to obtain the corresponding percentage of the grade under this
category. I will evaluate your participation every class. If you miss class you will not receive any kind of
credit for that missed class regardless of the reason for your absence, even if you decide to complete the
written class activity.</p>	
	
<h5>Evaluation criteria for class participation</h5>
<p>I will assess whether and how well you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course for the class
participation component of the grade according to the participation rubric.</p>

<p>Extensions, waivers, reschedules, rewrites, make-ups, and extra-credit activities are considered privileges,
given on a case by case basis and as a matter of courtesy. For further clarification, I may or may not grant
them or I may grant them to some of you and not to others, depending on a number of factors. In general,
I will only grant privileges in exceptional circumstances. The following are examples of circumstances that
may never be considered exceptional: internet outages, computer or printing problems, compliance with a
job supervisor‟s request to do overtime or an extra shift, or sports commitments. You must plan ahead in
order to comply with all the course requirements. This means, among other things, not starting your work
the night before the deadline. You must request a privilege in writing. If I grant it, you must keep a copy of
the privilege given by me in writing. Privileges not requested in writing and not given in writing are not
valid.</p>
	
<h5>Grading Scale</h5>
	
A  90 - 100%<br>
B  80 - 89%<br>
C  70 - 79%<br>
D  60 - 69%<br>
F  Below 60%<br>
	
<h5>Computer Matters</h5>
<p>In this class, the wise use of technology means saving everything—and saving it more than once.
<em>Truly wise students will save ALL work in at least three places.</em> Possibilities include:
 <ul>
 <li>your flash drive</li>
 <li>your email</li>
<li>the desktop of your PC</li>
</ul>
If you don’t save your work in more than one place, you’ll risk losing your work, and if you lose
your work, I can’t help you. This is your responsibility, and “the computer ate my homework” is
not an acceptable excuse. 
	
<h5>Classroom Manners</h5>
<p>Most of you have been at the University for at least a semester now, and you know how to
behave in a university classroom. Please behave that way here. You also have a pretty good
idea of how an instructor should conduct herself, and I promise to do that as well. Let’s all 
<strong>be respectful of ourselves and each other.</strong> If we do that, our classroom will 
be a place where we’re all comfortable; that’s the essence of civility.</p>
	
<h5>Intellectual Dishonesty and Cheating</h5>
<p>Intellectual dishonesty involves the theft of other people’s words or ideas, and that’s
unacceptable in this and all university courses. Cheating is letting someone else do your work
for you. That’s unacceptable as well.
If you don’t do your own thinking and writing, you can hardly expect to improve as a thinker or
writer. Therefore, I expect that the writing you submit to me will be your own work. That’s the
only way we can tell what kind of progress you’re making! </p>

<h5>COMPUTER USE POLICY</h5>
<p>The Computer Use Policy was given to you at the departmental 
orientation your first semester as a student in the department. A copy 
of the policy is in a pocket folder located at the front of each of 
the computer labs for your reference.</p>
	
<h5>Safety</h5>
<p>The safety procedures and rules are posted on the bulletin boards in the 
upstairs and downstairs hallways and at the front of each of the classrooms.&nbsp; 
Located in the same area is the evacuation plan.&nbsp; The safety procedures are 
in the packet of information that was given to you at the departmental orientation 
your first quarter as a student. Be sure to view the
<a href="main_files/DISASTER_DRILL_PROCEDURE.doc">disaster drill</a> information.</p>
